# Power BI Data Analysis Project: Day Lewis

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis exercise using Power BI and an Excel dataset, aiming to explore key metrics and trends from the provided data. The project utilizes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques to present insights for business decision-making.

The data is rendered as a table in Power BI, providing an interactive and easy-to-understand view of the metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you need:

1. **Power BI Desktop**: Download and install Power BI Desktop from the official Microsoft Power BI website.
2. **Excel**: To view or modify the data source, you need software capable of opening `.xlsx` files, such as Microsoft Excel or any compatible spreadsheet program.

### Files Included

- `Day Lewis.pbix`: The main Power BI file containing the data model and visualizations.
- `Data Dump Exercise-M - Copy.xlsx`: The Excel file used as the data source for the analysis. It contains raw data that is cleaned and processed within Power BI.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Download the Files**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open Power BI File**: Launch Power BI Desktop and open the `Day Lewis.pbix` file.
3. **Load Data Source**: Ensure that the Excel file (`Data Dump Exercise-M - Copy.xlsx`) is in the same directory as the Power BI file, or adjust the data source path in Power BI if necessary.

   - Navigate to "Home" > "Transform Data" > "Data Source Settings" to update the path if needed.
4. **Refresh the Data**: Once the file is opened, refresh the data by selecting "Refresh" on the Power BI ribbon to load the most recent data from the Excel file.

## Examples of Data Analysis

The `Data Dump Exercise-M - Copy.xlsx` file contains the following data fields:

In Power BI, this data is transformed into various tables and visualizations, including:

1. **Sales Performance Table**: A table that shows the breakdown of sales across different time periods and regions.
2. **Customer Insights Dashboard**: Visualizations that provide insights into customer behavior and trends.
3. **Revenue and Growth Analysis**: Charts that display revenue trends over time and growth percentages.

This table provides a detailed breakdown of sales data, including item descriptions, quantities, costs, and sales amounts for each transaction.

## Usage

- **Explore Data**: You can interact with the Power BI dashboards and visualizations to explore the data, filter by specific criteria, and dive deeper into trends.
- **Generate Reports**: Use the built-in Power BI reporting features to generate and export reports in various formats (PDF, Excel, etc.).
- **Modify Analysis**: If needed, you can modify the analysis by adjusting the data transformations, creating new measures, or adding new visualizations to meet specific business requirements.
